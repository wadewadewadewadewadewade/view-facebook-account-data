# view-facebook-account-data

This is a playground I'm using to look at my exported user data from Faceook. I was just using the ZIP that I downloaded as a starting point for looking inside ZIP files from within Node.js. But I haven't decided what I'd like to do yet.

Also, this repo doesn't actually do anything yet. I just checked it into GitHub so that I can work on a laptop and a desktop and share code easily between the two.
